# Tasks from my Compiler Construction course

## Overview
This repository contains tasks from Compiler Construction course I've taken at my University. Theese files won't work on their own, since framework for them was provided by my prof, and I'm uncertain if I can publish it. These tasks included lexer, parser and Finite Automata from Regular Expressions â€” Thompson Construction.
